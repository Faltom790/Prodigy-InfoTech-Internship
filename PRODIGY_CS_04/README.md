# Keylogger Program

## Overview
This keylogger program is designed to capture keystrokes from the keyboard and log them to a file. It includes various features and considerations to ensure smooth operation, proper error handling, and data protection.

## Features
1. **Logging**: Captures keystrokes from the keyboard and logs them to a specified file.
2. **Logging Setup**: Utilizes Python's logging module for efficient logging with timestamps.
3. **Exception Handling**: Gracefully handles errors to prevent program crashes.
4. **Proper Program Exit**: Ensures clean program exit with the ability to write remaining keys to the log file.
5. **Keyboard Interrupt Handling**: Handles Ctrl+C (KeyboardInterrupt) to exit the program cleanly.
6. **Data Protection**: Safeguards the log file to ensure it is only accessible to the user running the program.

## Implementation Details
- **Dependencies**: Requires the `pynput` library for keyboard monitoring.
- **Logging**: Logs keystrokes with timestamps using Python's logging module.
- **File Access**: Logs keystrokes to a specified file (`keylog.txt` by default), ensuring appropriate permissions and data protection.
- **Exception Handling**: Catches and logs any exceptions that may occur during program execution.
- **Program Exit**: Provides a function to handle program exit, ensuring that any remaining keys are properly logged before exiting.
- **Keyboard Interrupt Handling**: Catches Ctrl+C interrupts to gracefully exit the program.
- **Continuous Operation**: Runs the keylogger as a daemon process, continuously monitoring keystrokes in the background.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Permission**: Ensure explicit permission from the user before running the keylogger program.

## Usage
1. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install pynput`.
2. Run the keylogger program.
3. Obtain explicit permission from the user before monitoring their keystrokes.
4. Monitor the log file (`keylog.txt` by default) for captured keystrokes.

## Conclusion
This keylogger program provides a robust and secure solution for capturing keystrokes and logging them to a file. By implementing proper error handling and ethical considerations, it ensures responsible usage and compliance with privacy laws.
